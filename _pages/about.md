I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics at [UCLA](https://www.math.ucla.edu/), studying graph-based machine learning methods with [Dr. Andrea Bertozzi](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/). My undergraduate degree was in Applied and Computational Mathematics from [Brigham Young University, Provo](https://www.byu.edu/). 

Currently, I am supported by the DOD's National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship for the remainder of my Ph.D. I was previously supported by the NRT MENTOR Fellowship for the 2018-2019 academic year (Fall 2018- Summer 2019). 

I am interested in efficient machine learning that leverage the inductive biases of graph-based learning. I have been developing effective and scalable methods for active learning in graph-based semi-supervised classification problems.

More About Me
======

Besides a passion for machine learning and mathematics, I love my growing family. I also enjoy watching college basketball and football, bouldering, running, and having meaningful discussions with family and friends.
