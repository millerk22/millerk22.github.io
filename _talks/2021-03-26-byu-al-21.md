Guest Lecturer for Dr. Jared Whitehead's Mathematics of Machine Learning graduate level course at BYU. Presented my work on model change active learning for graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL), where we use the approximate change in the underlying SSL model as a measure of usefulness in the active learning process. This approximate change is efficiently done for a family of graph-based SSL models, using only a subset of the graph Laplacian's eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
