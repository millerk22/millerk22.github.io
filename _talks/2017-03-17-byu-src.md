Won prize for best presentation of my session of the BYU Spring Research Conference. Presented research on using effective resistance for use in link prediction by viewing link prediction as a probabilistic problem wherein we view the current graph's edge set as a realization of draws from an underlying probability distribution determined by a ground truth graph's effective resistances.
