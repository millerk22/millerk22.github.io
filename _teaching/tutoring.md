I am available to tutor any high school math subjects, as well as SAT/ACT math. I also tutor a variety of UCLA undergraduate mathematics courses, from lower division pre-calculus to upper division applied mathematics courses. Below is a sample list:

* MATH 1 (Pre-Calculus)
* MATH 3 ABC	(Calculus for Life Sciences)
* MATH 31 AB (Calculus)
* MATH 32 AB (Multivariate Calculus)
* MATH 33 AB (Linear Algebra / Ordinary Differential Equations)

## Background in Tutoring

I have always enjoyed tutoring others in math, whether simpler or more complicated topics. I have tutored or taught various subjects over the past 9 years. In high school I began tutoring calculus and precalculus, and during my undergrad I TA'd for a number of courses. While here at UCLA, I have tutored and TA'd for different classes, though I have the most experience tutoring and TA'ing the MATH 3 series. Contact me today to see how I can help! 

See below for some student evaluations from the courses that I was a TA for last school year: MATH 3B (Calc for Life Sciences) and PIC 16 (Python with Applications).
